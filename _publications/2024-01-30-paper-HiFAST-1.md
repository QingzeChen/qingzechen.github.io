The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) has the largest aperture and a 19-beam L-band receiver, making it powerful for investigating the neutral hydrogen atomic gas (Hi) in the universe. We present HiFAST (https://hifast.readthedocs.io), a dedicated, modular, and self-contained calibration and imaging pipeline for processing the Hi data of FAST. The pipeline consists of frequency-dependent noise diode calibration, baseline fitting, standing wave removal using an FFT-based method, flux density calibration, stray radiation correction, and gridding to produce data cubes. These modules can be combined as needed to process the data from most FAST observation modes: tracking, drift scanning, On-The-Fly mapping, and most of their variants. With HiFAST, the root-mean-square (RMS) noises of the calibrated spectra from all 19 beams were only slightly (∼5%) higher than the theoretical expectation. The results for the extended source M33 and the point sources are consistent with the results from Arecibo. The moment maps (0, 1 and 2) of M33 agree well with the results from the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey (AGES) with a fractional difference of less than 10%. For a common sample of 221 sources with signal-to-noise ratio S/N > 10 from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey, the mean value of fractional difference in the integrated flux density, Sint, between the two datasets is approximately 0.005%, with a dispersion of 15.4%. Further checks on the integrated flux density of 23 sources with seven observations indicate that the variance in the flux density of the source with luminous objects (Sint > 2.5 Jy km s−1) is less than 5%. Our tests suggest that the FAST telescope, with the efficient, precise, and user-friendly pipeline HiFAST, will yield numerous significant scientific findings in the investigation of the Hi in the universe.
