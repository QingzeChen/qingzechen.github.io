This talk presents the discovery of two "dark" HI clouds (Cloud N and S) identified during the FEASTS survey, located approximately 70–90 kpc from the center of the M51 galaxy. These clouds are strong candidates for RELHICs (REionization-Limited H I Clouds)—starless, gas-rich dark matter halos limited by cosmic reionization.
